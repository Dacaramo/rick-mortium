An app that tests all of my API consumption, data caching, state management and mobile responsiveness skills on web applications.

## Backlog

> This section contains all of the future functionalities that I want to the project

- Allow the user to view the search results in a list, not only a grid. The user will be able to switch between both views.
- Add a loading skeleton at the end of the list / grid when new results are being fetched.
- Implement image lazy loading.
